What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system 
affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and 
affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has 
no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing 
neurons in the brain

Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost – Objective
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an 
individual.
Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost – About the Python Machine 
Learning Project
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, 
numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. We’ll 
load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, 
build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
